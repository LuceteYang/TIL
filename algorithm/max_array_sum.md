## 문제
```
Given an array of integers, find the subset of non-adjacent elements with the maximum sum. Calculate the sum of that subset.

For example, given an array  we have the following possible subsets:

Subset      Sum
[-2, 3, 5]   6
[-2, 3]      1
[-2, -4]    -6
[-2, 5]      3
[1, -4]     -3
[1, 5]       6
[3, 5]       8
Our maximum subset sum is .

Function Description

Complete the  function in the editor below. It should return an integer representing the maximum subset sum for the given array.

maxSubsetSum has the following parameter(s):

arr: an array of integers
Input Format

The first line contains an integer, .
